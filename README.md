# annoying-calculator
an extremely annoying calculator (give it to someone you want them to feel true pain they can't get rid of)

works as an normal calculator until you divide something by 0(2/0) and the pain start

there is not virus/lag or anything like that, it's just an annoying calculator

you can view the kotlin code before using it to find out what is going to happen
